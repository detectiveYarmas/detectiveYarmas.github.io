<!-- I did not have enough time to get this to where I would have liked to, however I started my application 3 hours before the deadline of the next 
session I'd like to join, and I figured the worst that could happen would be a rejection and I can try again next time with more time. And when the best case is that I get accepted despite that,
it seems like the best bet to just see what happens with this. Thanks for your time. -->
